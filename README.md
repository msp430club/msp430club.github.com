## MSP430 Club Website

This repository contains the MSP430 Club website.

It uses Jekyll to turn the markdown templates into html.

I know almost nothing about Jekyll, so you should learn about it and make the site better. All I know is that posts go in the _posts folder and layouts go in _layouts.
